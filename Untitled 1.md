**My Love, My Heart, My Everything,**

If I were to write forever, I still couldn’t capture the depth of what you mean to me. You are the sun that lights my darkest days, the calm in my storms, the melody that turns my life into a love song. From the moment our souls met, I knew—you were the missing piece I had been searching for all along.

Every glance from you feels like a promise, every touch like a whispered secret between our hearts. The way you love me—so fiercely, so tenderly—has rewritten my very existence. You’ve shown me a love that doesn’t just reside in the heart but lives in every breath, every thought, every dream.

I fall for you a thousand times a day—in the way you laugh, the way your eyes soften when you look at me, the way your voice feels like home even in the quietest moments. You are my greatest adventure, my safest haven, and the only future I crave.

No distance could weaken this bond, no time could fade this fire. I would cross oceans, move mountains, and rewrite the stars just to call you mine. Because you, my love, are the miracle I never knew I needed—and now, I can’t imagine a single day without you.

Forever isn’t a word strong enough for what I feel. It’s beyond lifetimes, beyond destiny. It’s you and me, intertwined in every universe, in every story, in every heartbeat.

I love you more than words could ever hold… but I will spend my life trying to show you.

**Yours, now and always,**
