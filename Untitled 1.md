**My Kayden, My Andrew, My Will, My Sparkle, My Husband, My Lover, My Moon, My Love, My Heart, My Brain, My Soul, My Everything**

Even if I wrote forever, I couldn't capture the depth of what you mean to me. You are the sun that lights up my darkest days, the calm in my storms, the melody that turns my life into a love song. From the moment our souls met, I knew... you were the missing piece I'd been searching for all this time...

Every time I look at you, you give me a charm, every touch is like a caress between our hearts that says "We will love each other forever...". The way you love me, so intensely, so tenderly, changed my life completely. You have shown me a love that is not only in the heart, but lives in every breath, every thought, every dream, every damn second of life...

I fall in love with you a thousand times a day: in the way you laugh, in the way your eyes sparkle, in the way you get nervous, in the way you speak to me, in the way your voice feels like home even in the quietest moments. You are my greatest adventure, my safest refuge, and the future I most desire in my life.

No distance could weaken this relationship, no time could extinguish this fire. I would kill, cross oceans, move mountains, and rewrite the stars, just to tell you that you are mine. Because you, my love, are the miracle I never knew I needed, and now, I can't imagine a single day without you.

Forever is no word strong enough to describe what I feel. It goes beyond lifetimes, beyond destiny. It is you and me, literally intertwined in every universe, in every story, in every heartbeat, every kiss...

I love you more than words could express... but I will spend my life trying to prove it to you... to prove to you that I do love you... forgive my temper, I swear I'll change that... but you can be sure, I truly love you and I don't want to hurt you... if I didn't love you, I wouldn't be writing this... I value our relationship too much... and there is nothing like ours... it's just you and me...

**Wapply... Yours, now and always... ðŸ’ž**
