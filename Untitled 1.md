Even if I wrote forever, I couldn't capture the depth of what you mean to me. You are the sun that lights up my darkest days, the calm in my storms, the melody that turns my life into a love song. From the moment our souls met, I knew... you were the missing piece I'd been searching for all this time...

Every time I look at you, you give me a charm, every touch is like a caress between our hearts that says "We will love each other forever...". The way you love me, so intensely, so tenderly, changed my life completely. You have shown me a love that is not only in the heart, but lives in every breath, every thought, every dream, every damn second of life...

I fall in love with you a thousand times a day: in the way you laugh, in the way your eyes sparkle, in the way you get nervous, in the way you speak to me, in the way your voice feels like home even in the quietest moments. You are my greatest adventure, my safest refuge, and the future I most desire in my life.

No distance could weaken this relationship, no time could extinguish this fire. I would kill, cross oceans, move mountains, and rewrite the stars, just to tell you that you are mine. Because you, my love, are the miracle I never knew I needed, and now, I can't imagine a single day without you.

Forever is no word strong enough to describe what I feel. It goes beyond lifetimes, beyond destiny. It is you and me, literally intertwined in every universe, in every story, in every heartbeat, every kiss...

I love you more than words could express... but I will spend my life trying to prove it to you... to prove to you that I do love you... forgive my temper, I swear I'll change that... but you can be sure, I truly love you and I don't want to hurt you... if I didn't love you, I wouldn't be writing this... I value our relationship too much... and there is nothing like ours... it's just you and me...

**Wapply... Yours, now and always... ðŸ’ž**

Even if I wrote forever, I could never capture the depth of what you mean to me.  
You are the sun that lights my darkest days,  
The calm in my storms,  
The melody that turns my life into a love song.

From the moment our souls met, I just knew...  
You were the missing piece I'd been searching for all this time.

Every time I look at you, you charm me without trying.  
Every touch is a silent vow between our hearts whispering:  
_"We will love each other forever"_

The way you love me, so intensely, so tenderly  
Changed everything.  
Youâ€™ve shown me a love that isnâ€™t just felt in the heart,  
But lives in every breath, every thought, every dream,  
Every second of this wild, beautiful life.

I fall in love with you a thousand times a day:  
In your laugh,  
In the spark of your eyes,  
In the way you get nervous,  
In how you speak to meâ€”  
And how your voice feels like home, even in silence.

You are my greatest adventure,  
My safest place,  
And the future I long for with everything in me.

No distance could ever weaken this,  
No time could ever put out this fire.  
I would kill, cross oceans, move mountains,  
And rewrite the stars if it meant reminding you:  
**You are mine.**

You, my love, are the miracle I never knew I needed.  
Now I canâ€™t imagine a single day without you.

Forever isnâ€™t a strong enough word for what I feel.  
Itâ€™s beyond lifetimes.  
Itâ€™s beyond fate.  
Itâ€™s you and meâ€”  
Tied together in every universe,  
In every story,  
In every heartbeat,  
Every kiss.

I love you more than words could ever sayâ€¦  
But Iâ€™ll spend my whole life proving it to you.

Forgive my flaws, my temperâ€”  
I swear Iâ€™m trying to be better for you.  
Because if I didnâ€™t love you this deeply,  
I wouldnâ€™t be writing this at all.

Thereâ€™s nothing like us.  
There never will be.  
Itâ€™s just you and me.

**Wapply... Yours, now and always.**
