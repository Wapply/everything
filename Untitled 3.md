> And all that... is just a little bit of who you are to me.

Even if I wrote forever, I could never capture the depth of what you mean to me.  
You are the sun that lights my darkest days,  
The calm in my storms,  
The melody that turns my life into a love song.

From the moment our souls met, I just knew...
You were the missing piece I'd been searching for all this time.

Every time I look at you, you charm me without trying.  
Every touch is a silent vow between our hearts whispering:  
_"We will love each other forever"_

The way you love me, so intensely, so tenderly...
Changed everything.  
You’ve shown me a love that isn’t just felt in the heart,  
But lives in every breath, every thought, every dream,  
Every second of this wild, beautiful life.

I fall in love with you a thousand times a day:  
In your laugh,  
In the spark of your eyes,  
In the way you get nervous,  
In how you speak to me...  
And how your voice feels like home, even in silence.

You are my greatest adventure,  
My safest place,  
And the future I long for with everything in me.

No distance could ever weaken this,  
No time could ever put out this fire.  
I would kill, cross oceans, move mountains,  
And rewrite the stars if it meant reminding you:  
**You are mine.**

You, my love, are the miracle I never knew I needed.  
Now I can’t imagine a single day without you.

Forever isn’t a strong enough word for what I feel.  
It’s beyond lifetimes.  
It’s beyond fate.  
It’s you and me...
Tied together in every universe,  
In every story,  
In every heartbeat,  
Every kiss.

I love you more than words could ever say…  
But I’ll spend my whole life proving it to you.

Forgive my flaws, my temper...
I swear I’m trying to be better for you.  
Because if I didn’t love you this deeply,  
I wouldn’t be writing this at all.

_There’s nothing like us._
_There never will be._
_It’s just you and me._

**Wapply... All Yours, now and always.**
